# Lethe
Repository for the Lethe open source CFD project

Lethe is an open source computational fluid dynamics software which uses a stabilized continuous galerkin formulation to solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (among others). Lethe leverages the deal.ii open source framework for its finite elements formulation, Trilinos for it's sparse linear algebra and p4est for distribute adaptative quad/oct trees.

Lethe is still very much in it's infancy and is not production ready.
